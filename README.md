## SQL Query1
```sql
SELECT P.Productid, AVG(O.Unitprice) AS Average_Price, ProductName
FROM `Order Details` O 
JOIN Orders R ON 
O.orderid = R.Orderid 
JOIN Products P ON 
O.productid = P.productid
WHERE Orderdate BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31'
GROUP BY ProductName, P.Productid
ORDER BY P.productid ASC;
```
### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized below
- This show the average price of all the product that have been ordered in the year 1998
- Using functions like Join, Where, Group By, and Order By to get the analysis


  ### SQL Query2
````sql
SELECT S.Supplierid, S.CompanyName, SUM(OD.Unitprice * OD.Quantity) AS Total_Revenue
FROM Suppliers S
JOIN Products P ON 
S.supplierid = P.Supplierid
JOIN `Order details` OD ON 
P.productid = OD.Productid
JOIN Orders O ON 
OD.orderid = O.orderid
WHERE Orderdate BETWEEN '1997-01-01' AND '1997-12-31'
GROUP BY S.Supplierid, S.CompanyName;
````
### Results/Findings
The analysis of the results are summarized below
- Finding out the total revenue earned by each supplier in the year 1997

ON P.productid = OD.Productid
JOIN Orders O 
ON OD.orderid = O.orderid
WHERE Orderdate BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31'
